WETH is the wrapped version of ETH. WETH conforms to the ERC-20 standards, while ETH does not. WETH was created to be used in DeFi applications. There is no price difference between the two.

You can use a decentralized exchange like Sushi Swap to convert ETH to WETH. GonnaMakeIt Marketplace behind the scene converts your ETH token to WETH before executing a trade so you do not have to manually convert ETH to WETH.
