The primary requirements to farm are GMI and ETH tokens. A user can acquire these tokens by buying them at a centralized or decentralized exchange (e.g. Sushiswap). GMI tokens could also be received initially as part of the GMI airdrop feature during the NFT marketplace launch.

After a user acquires some GMI tokens, they can add liquidity to the GMI-ETH pair at a decentralized exchange.  A user can add liquidity by providing the same value of GMI and ETH tokens to the GMI-ETH pair at Sushi Swap and will get in return some GMI-ETH liquidity token (LP tokens). 

These LP tokens can then be staked in the farming pools.
