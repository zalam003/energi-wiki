After a user acquires some GMI tokens, he can deposit the tokens in the farming pool and choose lock-up options for him to stake. Users are incentivized when they lock up their GMI tokens in farming pools with long locking periods. This means they will receive higher GMI rewards in the pools with a more extended locking period. It should always be more beneficial to stake in a farming pool with a high locking period than staking in a farming pool with a low locking period and compounding the interest.
