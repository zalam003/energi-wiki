Transaction hash (txid) is an identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction on the blockchain. After your trade on GonnaMakeIt Marketplace completes, you will be presented with the txid for the transaction. You can use the txid on the [block explorer](https://explorer.energi.network/) to see details of the transaction.
