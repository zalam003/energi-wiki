The GMI Marketplace community will organically grow and thrive if you and your friends participate. GMI Referral Rewards encourages "grass-roots" marketing by rewarding you for your efforts.

The GMI Marketplace Referral Program will reward users for using the platform. This recurring reward program is active forever once you sign up. The rewards are paid in ETH on the Ethereum blockchain and must be claimed. The user is responsible for any gas fee to claim the reward.

## 1. How the GMI Marketplace Referral Program Works

Users visit the GMI Marketplace website, where they’ll find the Referral program page. Here users can accept a referral invitation. Accepting a referral invitation creates a transaction that is stored in an off-chain database to save on ETH gas fees. All our referral levels are tracked in this way.

On this page, users also generate their GMI Marketplace referral link that they can share with others. Anyone who accepts a GMI Marketplace referral link invitation receives a permanent 10% discount on their trading fees on the marketplace. Conversely, users can earn a 10% commission in trading fees from their referees’ transactions. The details of the reward amount are stored in the database. During a claim, the user will pay the ETH gas fee, and the information will be stored on the Ethereum blockchain. The database is also updated with the amount claimed.

## 2. Multi-Tier Rewards Benefit Both Current and Brand New Users

We provide multi-tier commissions on your referrals. You’ll receive 10% of the trading fees incurred by the first level of referral users you recruit. If any of them secure their own referrals, you earn an additional 5% on the second level participants. If those second-level participants get their own batch of referrals to sign up for GMI Marketplace, you make another 3% on these as the root recruiter of the referral network you’ve built. There’s no cap on how many people a GMI Marketplace user can add to their referral group. So when you help them save 10% on trading fees, you’re also able to help yourself by building a passive revenue stream. It’s truly a WIN-WIN scenario!

| Recipients        | Multi-Tier Reward |
| ----------------- | :---------------: |
| Tier 1 Referee    |        10%        |
| Tier 2 Referee    |         5%        |
| Tier 3 Referee    |         3%        |

Anyone who accepts a GMI Marketplace referral link invitation receives a permanent 10% discount on their trading fees on the marketplace.
