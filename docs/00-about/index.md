# Welcome to the Official Energi Documentation!

## Take the time to read the following points below for your own safety.

- The Official Energi releases are **ONLY** available for download on this wiki.

- **ALWAYS** make backups of your wallet/important data (such as private keys). Doing it periodically is a good habit. We recommend having an offline backup.

- Transactions **CANNOT** be reverted or cancelled. On a decentralized blockchain, there's no way to revert/stop transactions, please make sure to check as many times as possible that you're sending the funds to the correct address.

- You as user are completely **RESPONSIBLE** over your own security, please take time to evaluate every step followed and make sure to be as safe as possible.

## Energi Gen 3

Energi Core **Gen 1** was based on Dash while **Gen 2** was its Proof-of-Stake evolution. **Gen 3** is the next generation of cryptocurrencies overall as it builds coin governance consensus into upgradeable smart contracts.

Energi Core Gen 3 is based on Ethereum platform, but has own network with deeply modified consensus model and a custom Proof-of-Stake model which is based on ideas of Gen 2. A special one-time operation is required to claim Gen 2 coins into Gen 3 blockchain. The coins are claimed from a special migration snapshot. Such snapshot for mainnet will be announced ahead of time. Gen 2 chain will not be able to proceed once the snapshot is taken to avoid any doubts.

- **MyEnergiWallet** is the most easy-to-use Gen 3 wallet. It is based on the MyCrypto software.

- **Energi Core Node** is the foundation for Gen 3 decentralized network operations. It also supports CLI wallet and is 
designed for advanced users.

- **Energi Nexus** is designed to ease the process concerning Masternodes operations.

## Getting Started with Migration

Migrating Gen 2 NRG coins to Gen 3 NRG coins is a one-time operation. You can claim your Gen 3 coins any time after the Gen 3 blockchain is active. There is no deadline of when you have to complete the migration.
