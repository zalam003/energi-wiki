## How do I ensure my computer is secure?

Securing your computer is an important step to protect your NRG coins. If malware is on your system, hackers could steal your NRG coins.

We know it takes extra effort, especially if you are not a computer tech pro. Consider this: in the offline world, the more money you have, the more security you apply, correct? The same is true online, as the amount and value of your NRG grows its worth increasing your level of protection.

**Here is a basic list of things to do:**

**1.** Upgrade to a Vendor supported version of your Operating system (Windows and MacOS)

**2.** Turn on the security automatic scanning built into your Operating System (Windows or MacOS; on Windows use built-in Defender)

**3.** Turn on other security features that are built into your Operating System (Windows or MacOS; on Windows use Security Center)

**4.** Use strong passwords and a password manager such as *lastpass*, *1password*, or *dashlane*, to mention a few of them

**5.** Use 2-factor authentication where possible (There are various Authenticators apps from Google, Microsoft, LastPass and Duo Mobile.)

**6.** Avoid jail-breaking your mobile device or side-loading apps

**7.** Avoid leaving your laptop and mobile unattended when outside your home

**8.** Always lock your screen before stepping away

> **Note:** If you are not sure how to do these steps, please refer to official documentation from the Vendor website.
