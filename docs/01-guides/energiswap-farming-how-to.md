title: Energiswap Yield Farming Guide

This guide has detailed instructions on the following topics:

* [Prerequisites](#prereq)
* [Staking LP Tokens](#stake_lp)
* [Managing Rewards and Staked LP Tokens](#manage_stake)

:::info **NOTE**
> While staking LP tokens through Energi Yield Farming provides passive earnings like [Staking](https://wiki.energi.world/en/staking-guide) and [Masternodes](https://wiki.energi.world/en/masternode-guide), one should always consider the risk of **Impermanent Loss** when providing liquidity to automated market makers (AMM) platforms like Energiswap.
:::
