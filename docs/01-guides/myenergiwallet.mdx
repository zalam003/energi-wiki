# 3 - The 3-2-1 Backup rule
![whatis-pillar_321_backup.png](docs/assets/images/whatis-pillar_321_backup.png =500x)
:::info
> **The 3-2-1 Backup rule consist of :**
**-** Having (at least) 3 backups of your wallet
**-** Storing these backups on 2 different supports
**-** Keeping one backup off-site
:::
**3.1 -** The first backup will stay **on your machine** in a new folder for this usage!
(**NOT** in any installation folder, which might result in a loss)
**3.2 -** The second backup will be stored **in an USB key**.
**3.3 -** The third backup will be stored **in a Cloud service** (such as Google Drive), ensuring an off-site backup.
**3.4 -** Finally, **NEVER** store your password digitally. Always note it on paper and keep it somewhere safe.
