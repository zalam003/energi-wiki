You need an Ethereum address to use the GMI Marketplace. It can be an existing address or you can create a new one. We currently support MetaMask as the web3 wallet. Additional wallets will be added in the future.

Navigate to the [MetaMask Download Page](https://metamask.io/download) on any supported device and click the Install button. Depending on the device that is used to install MetaMask, you will have either the Browser extension (desktop) or app (mobile). Follow the initial instructions to either create or import an existing (Ethereum) account.

Go to the [GMI Marketplace](https://gonnamakeit.com) and click on **Connect to Metamask** on the top right corner of the page.

Link the address to the site which contains the smart contract for your collection by clicking the wallet on the top right corner of the screen.
