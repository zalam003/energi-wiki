title: Remove Liquidity from the Pools
---

This step-by-step guide will show you how to remove liquidity from an existing NRG-ETH pool. This guide is focused on Uniswap, but can be applied to any Decentralized Exchange (DEX).

NRG is an ERC-20 token representing NRG on the Ethereum blockchain in a 1:1 tokenization, managed via a smart contract and is backed by the NRG coin.

## 1. Prerequisites

You will need a web3 wallet such as MetaMask on your browser or mobile phone to remove liquidity from the NRG-ETH liquidity pool. If you need assistance in setting up MetaMask and adding the NRG token to it, look at the guides below:

**General:**

- [How to add liquidity to the NRG-ETH pool in Uniswap](https://wiki.energi.world/docs/guides/add-NRG-liquidity-uniswap)

**MetaMask:**

- [Add NRG to MetaMask](https://wiki.energi.world/docs/guides/add-NRG-chrome)

**Brave:**

- [Add NRG to Brave Crypto Wallet](https://wiki.energi.world/docs/guides/add-NRG-brave-crypto-wallet)

- [Add NRG to MetaMask Mobile](https://wiki.energi.world/docs/guides/add-NRG-metamask-mobile)

We are using MetaMask on a web browser in this guide as an example. You can use any web3 wallet that is compatible with Uniswap.

## 2. Connect MetaMask to the Uniswap App
