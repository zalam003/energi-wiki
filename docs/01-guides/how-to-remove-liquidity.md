This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to remove Liquidity from the ETH-GMI pair at the SushiSwap DEX liquidity pools.

You will need a supported Web3 wallet in order to do so. The platform provides support for multiple wallet services such as MetaMask, Portis and Coinbase Wallet. For the purpose of this guide, we will be using MetaMask.

Should you need assistance in creating a new wallet using MetaMask, kindly refer to the following guide:

- [MetaMask Quick Start Guide](/docs/guides/guide-metamask)

Additionally, we have a quicker version of this guide, to acquire GMI and manage liquidity positions to the ETH-GMI pair at the SushiSwap platform. The guide can be found at:

- [GMI on SushiSwap Quick Start Guide](/docs/guides/guide-sushiswap)

Keep in mind that in order to perform any activity over the SushiSwap platform, you will need to have enough ETH in your wallet to cover the transaction fees.

**1.1.** Navigate to SushiSwap and click on the **“Connect to a wallet”** button at the top-right of the screen.
