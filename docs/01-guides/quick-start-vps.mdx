## 2. Installing the Energi Core Node

### **2.1. Windows VPS:**

**2.1.1 -** Download the Energi Core Node Installer for Windows from the [Downloads Page](https://wiki.energi.world/downloads/core-node#windows). Once the download is complete, run the installer file and wait for it to finish installing the Energi Core Node.

**2.1.2 -** Open a new File Explorer window, then navigate to the folder below and paste a copy of your walletâ€™s keystore file in this folder so the Energi Core Node can recognize it:

```
%APPDATA%\EnergiCore3\keystore
```

**2.1.3 -** After importing your wallet file to the specified folder on **step #2**, navigate to the Start Menu and run **Core Node** first, then **Attach**.

**2.1.4 -** Your Core Node will start synchronizing and the logs will be visible in the **Core Node** window. Using the **Attach** window, you will be able to interface with the interactive console and perform administrative tasks on your Node.

:::info
You can follow the synchronization progress by using the `nrg.syncing` command on your `Attach` terminal.

**Keep in mind that for new installations, it can take an average of 48 hours to completely synchronize your node to the latest block**.

### **2.2. Linux VPS:**

**2.2.1 -** Log into your VPS instance with either **root** or the administrator login provided during the VPS creation process, if applicable.

**2.2.2 -** Once logged in, run the following commands to start the installation. **Make sure** to save the password for the **nrgstaker** user provided during the process.

```
sudo bash -ic "$(wget -4qO- -o- raw.githubusercontent.comergicryptocurrencyergi3-provisioning/master/scripts/linuxergi-linux-installer.sh)" ; source ~/.bashrc
```

**2.2.3 -** The Core Node process will be running in the background. You will be able to check its status using the following command:

```
sudo systemctl status energi3
```

To access the Core Node console and perform administrative tasks, the following command can be used:

```
energi3 attach
```

:::info
You can follow the synchronization progress by using the `nrg.syncing` command after attaching to the Core Node console.

**Keep in mind that for new installations, it can take an average of 48 hours to completely synchronize your node to the latest block**.

## 3. Next Steps

Once the Core Node is fully installed and synchronized with the latest block on the network, you will be ready to start staking your NRG or announce your masternode if you meet the requirements for doing so.

* For Staking, you need at least **1 NRG** available in your wallet. The steps to start staking on your Core Node instance can be found in our [Staking Guide](https://wiki.energi.world/staking-guide).

* If you have a minimum of **1,000 NRG** and wish to run a masternode, you can find more details on announcing your new masternode in our [Masternode Guide](https://wiki.energi.world/masternode-guide).
