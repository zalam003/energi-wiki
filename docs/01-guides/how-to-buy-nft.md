How to buy an NFT

In order to start using the marketplace, you will need to have an Ethereum address and use a supported wallet service. Currently, we only support MetaMask. You can find more information about installing and using MetaMask, as well as the required network parameters for the Energi network, in the following guide:

- [MetaMask Quick Start Guide](../guides/guide-metamask)

## 1. Connect to Wallet

**1.1.** Navigate to the main [GonnaMakeIt Marketplace](https://test.gonnamakeit.com) page and click “Connect to Metamask”. Enter your MetaMask password on the pop-up if you have not already logged into MetaMask.

**1.2.** The first time you connect your wallet address to GonnaMakeIt, you will be asked to sign the message. This is an off chain transaction. You will not have to pay gas.

**2.7.** A message will appear on the bottom right of the screen to indicate the purchase has been written on the blockchain.



## 3. Make Offer

**3.1.** You can make an offer to buy an NFT that is listed on the GonnaMakeIt Marketplace. The owner has to accept your offer to initiate the transaction.

**3.2.** From the GonnaMakeIt Marketplace, click “Marketplace” from the navigation bar and scroll to the NFT you would like to buy. Click “Make Offer”.
