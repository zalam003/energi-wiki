Energiswap is a web-based Decentralized Finance (DeFi) application based on the Uniswap codebase. You need MetaMask on Chrome or Crypto Wallets on Brave to swap or provide equity on Energiswap. You can also use the MetaMask app on your mobile device. The application uses the Energi blockchain network for all the transactions and NRG coins are used to pay transaction and gas fees.

## 1. Set Up Environment
If you have not yet installed the MetaMask extension or mobile app, or set up the Crypto Wallets feature on your browser, please follow the instructions below.

## ​3.​ Energiswap App

:::note
After adding the custom Energi Mainnet network, it’s possible that you might still see your fees being calculated in “ETH”, as well as the Ethereum Icon (![](../assets/images/energiswap-mainnet/eth-icon.png)) instead of NRG (![](../assets/images/energiswap-mainnet/nrg-icon.png)). The reason this happens is due to MetaMask automatically pulling data for Ethereum by default. You do not need to worry about spending any ETH you might have, as long as you make sure to be connected to the Energi Mainnet network as instructed by the previous steps. We have already reached out to MetaMask to include native support for NRG.
:::
