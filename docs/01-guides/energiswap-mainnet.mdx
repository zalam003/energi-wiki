Energiswap is a web-based Decentralized Finance (DeFi) application based on the Uniswap codebase. You need MetaMask on Chrome or Crypto Wallets on Brave to swap or provide equity on Energiswap. You can also use the MetaMask app on your mobile device. The application uses the Energi blockchain network for all the transactions and NRG coins are used to pay transaction and gas fees.

## 1. Set Up Environment
If you have not yet installed the MetaMask extension or mobile app, or set up the Crypto Wallets feature on your browser, please follow the instructions below.

## ​3.​ Energiswap App

:::note
After adding the custom Energi Mainnet network, it’s possible that you might still see your fees being calculated in “ETH”, as well as the Ethereum Icon () instead of NRG (). The reason this happens is due to MetaMask automatically pulling data for Ethereum by default. You do not need to worry about spending any ETH you might have, as long as you make sure to be connected to the Energi Mainnet network as instructed by the previous steps. We have already reached out to MetaMask to include native support for NRG.
:::
 

### ​3.1.​ Access the Energiswap App & Connect to Wallet

#### ​3.1.1.​ In the browser (Chrome browser, Brave browser, or the MetaMask app browser), type the following URL and then press Enter:

[https://app.energiswap.exchange](https://app.energiswap.exchange)

 

#### ​3.1.2.​ Make sure your MetaMask is connected to the Energi Mainnet, then click the “Connect to a wallet” button.



 



 

#### ​3.1.3.​ Select MetaMask.



 

#### ​3.1.4.​ A screen like the example below will pop up. Select the account(s) you want to link to Energiswap and click “Next”.



 

#### ​3.1.5.​ Click “Connect” to allow Energiswap to access your wallet.



 

#### ​3.1.6.​ If the connection is successful, you will see your connected wallet as well as your current NRG balance.



 

### ​3.2.​ Swap Tokens
The token swap example in this guide is between NRG and ETH tokens.  You can use any tokens as long as you possess coins in those tokens.

 

#### ​3.2.1.​ Click on the browser to access the Energiswap app (2.1.1). The NRG token will appear as the default “From” token. Do not change it for the initial swap. Click “Select a token”.



 

#### ​3.2.2.​ Select “ETH”.

mceclip0.png

 

#### ​3.2.3.​ Enter the amount of ETH you want to swap. The amount of NRG will be automatically calculated based on the market price. Click “Swap”.

#### ​3.3.1.​ To provide liquidity, select “Pool” and click “Add Liquidity”:



 

#### ​3.3.2.​ NRG will be the first token (1) and will appear by default. Click “Select a token” to select the second token. The two tokens will provide liquidity to the pair. You will need to have sufficient coins on both the tokens to provide liquidity.



 

#### ​3.3.3.​ Select ETH.

When entering the amount of asset A, the amount of asset B will be automatically adjusted to match this ratio. Click “Approve ETH”.

mceclip6.png

 
:::note
Leave some NRG in your wallet to cover gas fees. You may need to create a new pair if the pair you want to add liquidity to does not exist yet. You can choose the amounts of assets you want to provide and this will determine the initial price of the pair.
:::
 

#### ​3.3.5.​ Confirm the transaction fee.

mceclip0.png

By clicking on one of your liquidity positions, you should see the details of the position and the ‘Add’ and ‘Remove’ buttons. You should also see a link to the energiswap.info pair analytics page.

mceclip3.png

 

#### ​3.4.1. Adjust amount of liquidity to be removed

You can remove part or all of your liquidity by clicking the ‘Remove’ button to access the ‘Remove liquidity’ screen. On this screen, you can adjust the amount of liquidity you wish to remove (from 1 to 100% of the liquidity you provided).

mceclip5.png


#### ​3.4.2. Approve and remove liquidity
